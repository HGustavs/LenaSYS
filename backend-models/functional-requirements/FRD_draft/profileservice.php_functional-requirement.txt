Check login


Description/input/output:
Check if the user is a super user, if they are, block access to below methods or set $status = “wrongpassword” .
If the system notices that the user is a superuser then $status = “teacher”, this will in turn bring a super user down to the echo part of the file at row 113.
The user can choose to either change update the users security question (Challenge) or update password (Password)
The system gets the right user by comparing the user's input (password) with what's in the database. This will grant the user access to the methods.


73 - if the previous statement (select access from user_course) returns > 0 rows, the user must be a teacher, since a row will be affected, hence the rowCount will return > 0. This seems to be kept as extra safety measures if the first if statement at row 47 is somehow bypassed.


Testing here only affects non-functional requirements, however testing if a superuser can somehow access challenge/password changing overall might be possible.


—------------------------------------------------------
Challenge


Functional:
A non-superuser will be able to change challenge/security question.


Description/Input/Output:
The user updates the securityquestion and securityquestionanswer in the user table. If everything went successfully the $success will be set to “true”.


Testing possibilities: Try changing challenge question while logged into a superuser/teacher.


—------------------------------------------------------
Password


Functional:
A non-superuser will be able to change password.


Description/Input/Output:
The user updates the password in the user table. If everything went successfully the $success will be set to “true”.


Testing possibilities: Try changing password while logged into a superuser/teacher.


—------------------------------------------------------






$success, $status and $debug will get output as a json array.
If everything went well the $success should output “success”, $status should output nothing, and $debug should output “NONE!” or error messages.
Furthermore, for description, logging is done during the process of accessing and ends after completion of either method. This could perhaps be tested, although this only affects the non-functional aspect of the file.
