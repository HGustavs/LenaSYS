This service allows anyone with R access (for example a teacher) to edit/create courses and users. Depending on the value of the variabel "opt" one of following functions (described as methods in class diagram) will be executed:

opt = UPDATE:
* Update user table
* Update course table

* Add new course (opt = ADDCLASS)
* Change user password (opt = CHPWD) - logged in logUserEvents()
* Add new user (opt = ADDUSR)


There is also a big function for gathering all information about courses which is described as retriveAllCourses() in class diagram.
