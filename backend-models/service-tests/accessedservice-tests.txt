To make sure the update of a user works and what response it will get form the database.
It can be done by creating a user with SQL-query.
   SQL-query: insert into user( username, email, firstname, lastname, ssn, password, addedtime, class) 
       VALUES ( :username, :email, :firstname, :lastname, :ssn, :password, now(), :class)
Then make an update by useing SQL-query.
   SQL-query: UPDATE user SET username=:username WHERE uid=:uid
To update the username of the user. The values to be checked are username and uid.
If the update was unable to succeed, it should display an error message which says 
that the user does not exist in the database.
