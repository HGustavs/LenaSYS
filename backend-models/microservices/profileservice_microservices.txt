Microservices:
log session - log start and end of service use.
check login - check if user is a student or teacher.
update challenge question
update password


---------------
Arguably the checklogin can be used as a microservice, a type of checklogin that specifically blocks superusers/teachers from access.
It is hard to say that this is used in other files, but if it is, it can most likely be split apart from this file.
