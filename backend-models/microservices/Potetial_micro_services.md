### hasAccess

This function is currently housed in session.php and might therefore not be something that should be transitioned to a micro service..

@param int __$userId__ User ID of the user to look up
@param int $courseId ID of the course to look up access for
@param string $access_type A single letter denoting read or write access (r and w respectively)
@return bool Returns true if the user has the requested access on the course and false if they don't.
```
