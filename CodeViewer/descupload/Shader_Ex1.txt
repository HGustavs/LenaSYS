This example shows us how to perform per pixel diffuse lighting of the scene. 
Below we see the shader that renders the image. 

By moving the computation of N and L (normalization) and the diffuse computation using the dot product to the vertex shader we are computing the lighting per pixel instead of per vertex.

For diffuse lighting the difference is almost impossible to notice.
