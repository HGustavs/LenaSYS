NOTE: You can check what all tests do by opening the file in your browser.


retrieveAccessedService_ms.php (MISSING): Note, since the frontend for accessedservice.php, is not finished it's not possible to test that the retrieveAcessedService_ms.php or any related microservice to accessedservice.php works. Once the frontend is implemented, testing of the microservices will be possible. Until then this issue will be on hold.

addClass_ms_test.php (NEED TO BE TESTED): The test for this microservice was created before the retrieveAccessedService_ms.php was created. Therefore, go over the test again and make sure it works once the retrieveAccessedService_ms.php has been implemented. If it does not work as aspected, make sure it does.

updateUser_ms_test.php: Self explanatory test. However the test is missing output so test 3 will fail.
