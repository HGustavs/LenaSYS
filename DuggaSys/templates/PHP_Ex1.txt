#### **Overview**
The PHP code (highlighted in green) is executed. In this case it writes the text "Hello!" to the web page.

Any code that is not inside the PHP tag is copied verbatim (i.e. character for character). 

The echo command writes some text to the web page. This text can either be normal text or html code. 

The resulting page thus contains the html code above and below the PHP code and the text "Hello!" generated by the php code. 

The PHP code can be executed by clicking the heading above. Please verify the result by viewing the source of the generated document in the browser.

**Web Page Output:**
~~~
Hello!
~~~
