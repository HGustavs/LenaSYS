This example shows us how to perform displacement mapping of the scene. 
Below we see the shader that renders the image. 

Rim lighting mimics the fresnel reflections that appear in very shiny objects such as glass orbs.

In this type of surface the reflection is brighter when the object is angled away from the viewer

By using the dot product between the Eye Vector and the Normal we get this angle, and by using a smoothstep (smoothstep(0.5,0.05,dot(N,E));) we only get the angles that are at angles pointed away from the viewer.
