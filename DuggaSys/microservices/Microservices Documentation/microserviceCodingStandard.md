## retrieving data: GET

the place where you are retrieving data needs to use curl to call the php file.
In this case, it is _readCourseVersion_ that gives you the data for _$versions_.

```php
// Retrieve Course Versions from microservice 'readCourseVersions_ms.php'
$baseURL = "https://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];

$url = $baseURL . "/LenaSYS/duggaSys/microservices/sectionedService/readCourseVersions_ms.php";
$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

$data = json_decode($response, true);

$versions = $data;
```


This ensures your code works in both development and production without
changing URLs manually
```php
$baseURL = "https://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
```

Now, add the specific path to the microservice:
```php
$url = $baseURL . "path/to/the/microservice";
```

Youâ€™ll use cURL to send a GET request to the microservice:
```php
$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
```

The microservice should return JSON. We decode it into a PHP associative array:
```php
$data = json_decode($response, true);
```


You need to check if the microservice you are calling have something
like this at the bottom:
```php
echo json_encode($data);
``` 

if it does not, there are several modifications you will have to do.
1. Remove the function body
2. Replace the _return $data_ at the bottom with _echo json_encode($data)_


Now you have retrieved the data with cURL instead of using includes!
## sending data: POST

Instead of calling functions to send data and do something with them we should use http POST.
To do this we will set up a curl call to the place we want to send data to, in the example below we do it to setAsActiveCourse_ms.php.

### Calling function

```php
    header("Content-Type: application/json");
    //set url for setAsActiveCourse.php path
    $baseURL = "https://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
    $url = $baseURL . "/LenaSYS/DuggaSys/microservices/sharedMicroservices/setAsActiveCourse_ms.php";
    $ch = curl_init($url);
```

The header tells the application that the data sent will be json data.
$baseURL is used to determine if the call is located on localhost or a server and the rest is the path to the file, this should later be changed to be found in a database instead of hardcoding it.
curl_init starts the curl call.

We must now set up the options we want on the curl call, since this is a POST where we do not want an answer we will set the following options:

```php
    //options for curl
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, false);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, http_build_query([
        'cid' => $cid, 'versid' => $versid
    ]));
   
    curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
```

First option says we don't want a return answer, next is that we want to use POST, and finally the last option is what the POST fields should contain. For the content of the POST fields we build a http query and assign variables like you normally would in a POST call. 
Once we have set our options we can execute the curl call and close it after, as is best practice.

### Receiving function

To receive the values from the POST request we check if the request method is POST (so that we don't check GET or other requests) if this is true we check if the variables are set and if they are we can use them in our query.
After this we can do the query we want just as usual.

```php
    //get values from post
    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
        if (isset($_POST['cid'], $_POST['versid'])) {
            $cid = $_POST['cid'];
            $versid = $_POST['versid'];
        }
    }

    //set active course in database
    $query = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE course SET activeversion=:vers WHERE cid=:cid");
    $query->bindParam(':cid', $cid);
    $query->bindParam(':vers', $versid);
```
