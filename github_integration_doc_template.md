# Github Integration

## Overview

(This should contain a description of what the entire github integration entails, and a summary of the documentation.)

## Contents

(At the point of writing, this is what the table of contents looks like. If you cannot find a suitable place to add your documentation, add your own headings, just make sure to follow the structure below to make the text consistent.

Also be sure to link the headings you add in the contents to the heading further down in the document.)

#### Integration
* Create Course
* Update Course
* Update Moment
* Update Code Example
#### SQLite
* Tables and Columns
#### Markdown
*


## [Category heading - what part of the integration does your code belong to? Eg. “SQLite”]

### [Section heading - when does your code run? Eg. “Create Course”]

Write down the functions in sequence starting with the one that happens first and continuing through the processes. 

If your work is connected with what’s already written down in the documentation, make sure you find the correct spot to start adding your documentation to. 

#### [Paragraph heading - Which function are you describing? Eg. “getCommit()”]

Write down how each function works and how they are connected to each other. What parameters does it need, what does it return, etc.

If applicable, be sure to mention which files your functions are in, and whether they are sent between different files in the project. 

If there is something in your code that depends on an outside factor (eg. in getCommit() in getLatestCommit.php we are using the class elements in github’s own HTML, which we have no control over), be sure to describe this dependency. This is so future developers can easily find the problem if an error occurs in the future. 

If you're mentioning functions that do not appear either right above or below what you're currently describing, make sure to link the function name to the corresponding paragraph heading so it's easy to navigate.
For example, [this](#paragraph-heading---which-function-are-you-describing-eg-getcommit) is a link to the paragraph heading above.
