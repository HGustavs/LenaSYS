        *The function isNumber is a single line function. It is unclear if this is allowed or not. Doing this is allowed for short if() 
         statments but the code standard does not explicitly state that it's allowed for short functions. If this is allowed then there
         is a large number of functions that could be made single line in dugga.js

        *Many violations of the rule to use innerHTML instead of DOM createElement and appendChild when apending a document. Some 
        document apending is however done correctly.
