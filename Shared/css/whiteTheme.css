/* This file is empty, this is because the file is deemed unessasary. This has to do with using style.css as the essential code for styling. 
If you want dark mode, you create a new file for that purpose only. But you do not create another file for just light mode.
The code that was here is now in the file style.css. There is a comment that says "CSS code from file whiteTheme.css". 
After that comment is everything that came from whiteTheme.css.*/
